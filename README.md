Runnnig & Testing the application
Overview:
• The application helps organize student information using hash tables and linked lists.
• Hash tables are used to store student records, with each student represented by a name
and an ID.
• Linked lists are employed within the hash table to handle collisions and manage
multiple student records that hash to the same index.
RunningtheApplication:
• To run the application, we'll need to compile the source code using a C++ compiler
like GCC or Clang.
• Once compiled, we can execute the program and start using it.
Testing The Application:
• First print the initial state of the hash table to see what student records are already
there. we can use the “printTable” function for this.
• Then, try adding some new students using the addStudent function and deleting
existing ones using deleteStudent.
• Check if the changes you made are reflected in the output and that the "students.txt"
file is updated accordingly.
ExploringDifferent Scenarios:
• We can experiment with various scenarios to see how the application handles
different cases. Such scenarios may include, adding multiple students with thesame
name or deleting a student that doesn't exist.
• We can also modify the "students.txt" file with different sets of student records to see
how the application responds.
SideNote:
• Make sure to use a valid txt file containing records of student names and Ids
